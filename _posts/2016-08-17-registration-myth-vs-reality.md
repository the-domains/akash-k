**REGISTRATION MYTH VS. REALITY**

**The biggest mistake is to assume that registering on the developer's website is the best way to get first access at the lowest price. Sales office personnel are working in the interest of the developer.**

**As Platinum VIP Realtor(r) we do not represent the Developer. We represent you & Get you priority access to new developments. Register with us directly to get access before official general public opening.**

**Prior to Opening Day of a new condo sales office to the general public, prices may have gone up several times and incentives revised.**

**As Platinum VIP Realtors, we are offering you an opportunity to be FIRST!**

**You will be invited to exclusive events and/or will be first to view pricing, floor plans and special Platinum VIP incentives. This guarantees you that you get first choice at the lowest initial pricing along with the best incentives.**
