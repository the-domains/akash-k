## WHY US

### **REGISTRATION MYTH VS. REALITY**

The biggest mistake is to assume that registering on the developer's website is the best way to get first access at the lowest price. Sales office personnel are working in the interest of the developer.

As Platinum VIP Realtor(r) we do not represent the Developer. We represent you & Get you priority access to new developments. Register with us directly to get access before official general public opening.

Prior to Opening Day of a new condo sales office to the general public, prices may have gone up several times and incentives revised.

As Platinum VIP Realtors, we are offering you an opportunity to be FIRST!

You will be invited to exclusive events and/or will be first to view pricing, floor plans and special Platinum VIP incentives. This guarantees you that you get first choice at the lowest initial pricing along with the best incentives.

### **NO FEE BENEFITS**

As your experienced Buyer Representatives, we will decipher developer contracts and all the ins and outs of the purchasing processes. We save you thousands while protecting your best interest based on our expertise, experience and knowledge in the Greater Toronto area condominium marketplace.

Not being represented properly or working with the developer unrepresented could be costly. The developer pays us and therefore you are not responsible to pay any fees for our services that save you thousands.

### **HOW DO WE SAVE YOU TIME AND MONEY**

1. Access to the First Release, before VIP Agents, general Realtors and general public
2. Analysis of project, suite choice, rental & resale comparable and market stats
3. Referral, to specialized pre-construction lawyers and mortgage agents
4. Immediate savings in thousands with Platinum VIP incentive programs
5. Consultation on project, neighbourhood, ideal layout and builder reputation
6. Assistance during pre-delivery inspection of your home or condo
7. Free Leasing (on closing) OR bonus cashback incentives
